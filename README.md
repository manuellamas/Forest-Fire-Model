### Main
Preliminaries
- [x] Understand im.show (in `main.py`)
- [x] Replicate using "standard" animation functions on `main_animation`

Alpha version (Make it show just without borders, without titles, just the animation)
- [x] Create a data matrix with which we'll work throughout the iterations.
- [x] Choose a random cell to act on at each new period
- Think of how you'll want to see the up/bot/left/right neighbors
- And of the edge cases of the cells on the edges, that have less neighbors





## More
Parameters:
- The p probability for lightining and tree spawning
- w,h number of "pixels" (i.e. squares)


Colors/states
- [x] Basic
  - Green if currently a tree unburned
  - Black if nothing or after being burned
- [ ] Improvements
  - [x] Red right after being burned
  - [ ] Maybe test a different version later where: it lingers for a few instances and doesn't let new a tree spawn on that spot while it does
